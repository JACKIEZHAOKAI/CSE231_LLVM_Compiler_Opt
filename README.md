# LLVM_Compiler_Optimization
•	Built the LLVM dataflow analysis framework (forward/backward analysis and the worklist algorithm) in C++ running on Docker.

•	Implemented lattice and flow function of Reaching Definition Analysis based on the data-flow analysis framework (forward analysis) using Functon Pass.

•	Implemented lattice and flow function of Liveness Analysis, May-point-to Definition Analysis (backward analysis) using Functon Pass.

•	Implemented inter-procedural modified global variables analysis(forward analysis) using callGraphSCC Pass.
