Instructions on compiling your own LLVM pass

 - Start the provided docker image by running "sudo ./mount_and_launch.sh"
 - Your "src" folder should be mounted at /LLVM_ROOT/llvm/lib/Transforms/CSE231_Project
 - You only need to compile your new pass(es) so we'll move directly into the CSE231_Project build folder. To do that type "cd /LLVM_ROOT/build/lib/Transforms/CSE231_Project"
 - Everything is pre-configures. You only need to run "make"
 - If everything went well, you should be able to find your pass under /LLVM_ROOT/build/lib/
 - Done!
